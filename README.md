# Bayesian LSTM Implementation in PyTorch

Inspired by: Deep and Confident Prediction for Time Series at Uber (2007)

Bayesian Neural Networks are gaining interest due to their highly desirable properties
of providing quantifiable uncertainties and confidence intervals, unlike equivalent frequentist methods.

This repository demonstrates an implementation in PyTorch and summarizes several key
features of Bayesian LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks through a real-world example of forecasting building energy consumption.
The Appliances energy prediction dataset used in this example is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+energy+prediction)
